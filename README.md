## What is it?
[play-with-ghost](http://play-with-ghost.com/) is a playground to try and learn about Ghost. No need to register or share your email. Just play-with-ghost. http://play-with-ghost.com/

## Expectations
1. This repo is mainly used to follow up [features and issues](https://github.com/pascalandy/play-with-ghost/issues) along the [ZenHub board](https://github.com/pascalandy/play-with-ghost#boards?repos=98054594). See it as our public backlog.
2. It is not to manage source code.
3. The [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/pascalandy/play-with-ghost/issues/15) will simply be maintained as a conversation at the moment.

## Issue definition
If you are not used to Github and developement stuff, an issue only means there is something to track or to manage. It does not mean there is a bug or anything wrong.
